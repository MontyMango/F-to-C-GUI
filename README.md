# F-to-C-GUI
A GUI that converts F° to C° and vise versa. This python program uses the tkinter package to run the GUI.

# How to use
1. You do need Python 3.x (Any Python 3) to run this file. So download that first.
2. When Python 3.x is downloaded, double click the file to run.
3. When the file runs, you can see the window to the left below. Fill in a number in the number bar to be converted, 
and then click "F° -> C°" to convert fahrenheit to celsius or "C° -> F° to convert celsius to fahrenheit.
4. A pop up will appear with your converted values like the left window in the picture. Click "OK" to return to the application.

5. If you want to do another conversion, go back to step 3. If you want to quit, click the X.
